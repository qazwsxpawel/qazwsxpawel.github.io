> But the more you offload your memories onto hard drives and into the Cloud, the more your memory becomes, in a very real sense, artificial. Technically, someone who spends all day in front of a screen has no memories of their own except for going to the fridge for a Cokeâ€¦

You can better use computers by clearly defining what they are and then seeing what that entails.

**Computers are there to help you think.** OK, there is a problem you need to solve that involves using a computer. Debugging? Writing an essay? Report? 1,000,000 emails to write? Go ahead, look outside the window and think. Maybe youâ€™ll find yourself pondering something inspired by the stuff on your computer. And after maybe you will find yourself typing away on the keyboard implementing your solution. What matters though is what happened in-between.

**Computer is a tool.** It should always be used as one. You should always feel in control of what you are doing and why when you use a computer. There pretty deceptive little creaturesðŸ’». If you are not using the computer, computer is using you.

**Computer is there to help your creativity.** Donâ€™t let your computering mindless and uninspired. There are so many ways that you can make it pleasant and fulfillingâ€Šâ€”â€Šthere is no reason to settle on a dehumanising, depressing experience. There always is a better, mind expanding, way (which does not necessarily involve illegal substances).

**Computer from the early days was used to connect people.** Always remember that the end goal of whatever you are doing on a computer is to express yourself. Sometimes itâ€™s a matter of reframing your goals and changing your ways. Always keep communication and connection with other people as your top priority.

**Computer is a small box on you desk.** Itâ€™s not real i.e. itâ€™s not your reality. Itâ€™s only a tiny part of the world that surrounds you. At the same time itâ€™s a opening to some other space. Immerse yourself in the space outside that window in a short and focused experience. Donâ€™t loose your balanceâ€Šâ€”â€Šuse that experience to fuel your engagement with the world around.
