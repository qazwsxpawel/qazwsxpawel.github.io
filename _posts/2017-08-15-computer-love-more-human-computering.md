> But the more you offload your memories onto hard drives and into the Cloud, the more your memory becomes, in a very real sense, artificial. Technically, someone who spends all day in front of a screen has no memories of their own except for going to the fridge for a Cokeâ€¦

You can make your use of computers much better if you clearly define what they are to you and then see what that entails.

**Computer is a tool.** It should always be used as one. You should always feel in control of what you are doing and why when you use a computer. There pretty deceptive little creatures  ðŸ’». If you are not using the computer, computer is using you.

**Computer is there to help your creativity.** Donâ€™t let your computering be mindless and uninspired. There are so many ways that you can make it pleasant and fulfillingâ€Šâ€”â€Šthere is no reason to settle on a dehumanising, depressing experience. There always is a better, mind expanding, way (which does not necessarily involve illegal substances).

**Computers are there to help you think.** OK, you are faced with a task that you need to solve using a computer. Debugging? Writing an essay? Report? 1,000,000 emails to write? Where do you start? I say look outside the window and think. After that maybe you will find yourself typing away on the keyboard implementing your solution. What matters though is what happened in-between. You won't find answers on the computer.

**Computer from the early days was used to connect people.** Always remember that the end goal of whatever you are doing on a computer is to express yourself. Sometimes itâ€™s a matter of reframing your goals and changing your ways. Always keep communication and connection with other people as your top priority.

**Computer is just a small box on you desk.** Itâ€™s not real i.e. itâ€™s not your reality. Itâ€™s only a tiny part of the world that surrounds you. At the same time itâ€™s an opening to some other space. Immerse yourself in the space in a short and focused experience. Donâ€™t loose your balance---use that experience to fuel your engagement with the world around.
